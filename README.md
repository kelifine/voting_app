This app is my version of the Voting App from FreeCodeCamp.

To start using this program do the following:

Run command ‘npm install’ at root to install dependencies.
Run command ‘node server.js’ to begin localhosting of the application.

How to use
------------------
View, vote, and see the results of polls as an unauthenticated user. Log in with your GitHub account and you will be able to create polls, delete polls, share your polls with your friends, and add custom options to any poll.
